# CS2 POV Player

## üìå Project Description
CS2 POV Player is a Python-based tool designed to **automate and enhance the experience of watching CS2 demo files**. It allows users to:

- Select a `.dem` file via a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Parse the demo to extract player and round information.
- Automatically **skip to specific rounds** or follow a player's POV.
- **Manually skip rounds** using a hotkey (`N`).
- **Exit to the main menu** after the last round is played.
- Integrate with **OBS WebSocket** for automatic recording.

This tool is useful for **analysts, content creators, and competitive players** who need a streamlined way to review match footage efficiently.
